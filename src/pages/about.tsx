                  I&apos;m Luis Gonzalez, your go-to Full-Stack Web Developer and
                  Shopify Expert in the sunny locale of Miami, Florida.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My drive for coding, merged with a flair for design, has led
                  me to specialize in developing accessible, visually appealing
                  web applications using the latest tech.
                </p>

                <p>
                  My skill set is rooted in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I&apos;m
                  well-versed in frameworks like React, Next.js, Angular,
                  Node.js, and Express. I also have a firm handle on database
                  systems, including MongoDB and MySQL, enabling me to build
                  fast and user-responsive web apps.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Besides coding, I&apos;m a skilled UX/UI designer who uses Figma to
                  craft intuitive and attractive interfaces that enhance user
                  experience and keep them coming back.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I&apos;m also your Shopify guruâ€”creating custom Shopify themes that
                  stand out and setting up online stores that look great and
                  convert. My knack for SEO means your site won&apos;t just sparkle;
                  it&apos;ll be found.
                </p>

                <p>

                  Having immigrated to the United States as a child in the early
                  2000s, I take great pride in my Cuban heritage and strong
                  cultural identity. My family is of utmost importance to me,
                  and I am grateful for my wonderful wife and daughter, who
                  brings immense joy and love into my life every day.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Maintaining a healthy and active lifestyle is important to me,
                  and I prioritize hitting the gym regularly to stay fit and
                  energized. Exercise helps me stay focused and productive in my
                  work, as well as more present and engaged in my personal life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In my free time, I enjoy playing Dota 2 with my friends. This
                  game provides a fun and challenging way to unwind and connect
                  with others who share similar interests.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  I appreciate the strategic and team-oriented aspects of Dota 2
                  and enjoy the sense of accomplishment that comes with working
                  together to achieve a common goal.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Overall, a healthy work-life balance is essential to success
                  and happiness. By caring for myself and my loved ones and
                  enjoying my hobbies and passions outside of work, I can bring
                  my best self to everything I do.
